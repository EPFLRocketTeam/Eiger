 * Description : This file gathers all rocket specific constants that must be checked each time a
 * a design change occurs such as changing motor, adding mass, launching from a different altitude,...
 * It also includes calibration data such initial altitude.
 *
 * For a mass or motor change, check :
 * 	- ROCKET_CST_LAUNCH_TRIG_ACCEL
 * 	- ROCKET_CST_MIN_TRIG_AGL
